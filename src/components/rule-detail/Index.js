        Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep skillet over medium-high
        heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly
        browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a large plate and set aside, leaving
        chicken and chorizo in the pan. Add piment√≥n, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion,
        salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about 10
        minutes. Add saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth; bring to a boil.
